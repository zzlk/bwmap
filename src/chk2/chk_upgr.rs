// This section contains player upgrade restrictions: it indicates the starting/maximum levels at/to which a player can perform a particular upgrade.

// u8[46][12]: 1 byte for the maximum level a player can upgrade to, in order of its upgrade id, then each player
// u8[46][12]: 1 byte for the level of an upgrade a player starts off with, in order of its upgrade id, then each player
// u8[46]: 1 byte for the global default maximum level of each upgrade, in order of its upgrade id.
// u8[46]: 1 byte for the global default starting level of each upgrade, in order of its upgrade id.
// u8[46][12]: 1 byte for each upgrade in order of its upgrade id, then each player, indicating whether a player uses the global upgrade defaults:
// 00 - Player does not use global upgrade defaults for this upgrade
// 01 - Player uses upgrade defaults for this upgrade
// See #List of Upgrade IDs.
