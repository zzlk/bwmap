# bwmap
Rust implementation for parsing StarCraft .chk files.

https://bounding.net uses this library to parse StarCraft and StarCraft: Brood War maps and store them in its database.

Special thanks to the Staredit Network community over at http://staredit.net as well as the Staredit Network wiki (http://www.staredit.net/wiki/index.php/Scenario.chk) for documenting the format.

MPQ functionality is provided by [zzlk/stormlib-bindings](https://github.com/zzlk/stormlib-bindings)
