# bwmap
Rust implementation for parsing StarCraft .chk files. This is used by https://bounding.net to parse StaCraft maps.

Special thanks to the Staredit Network community over at http://staredit.net as well as the Staredit Network wiki (http://www.staredit.net/wiki/index.php/Scenario.chk) for documenting the format.
